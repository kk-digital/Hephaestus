TASK-69: Fix Test Failure - test_monitoring_with_resource_coordination
======================================================================
Date Created: 2025-11-06
Status: PENDING
Priority: HIGH
Category: Test Failure, Bug Fix

TEST INFORMATION:
=================

Test File: tests/test_monitoring_integration.py
Test Function: test_monitoring_with_resource_coordination

Full Test Name: tests/test_monitoring_integration.py::test_monitoring_with_resource_coordination

ERROR MESSAGE:
==============

Test failed (no error message captured)

TASK OBJECTIVES:
================

1. ANALYSIS
   - Review test code to understand what is being tested
   - Review application code that the test is validating
   - Identify root cause of test failure
   - Determine if failure is due to:
     * Bug in application code
     * Bug in test code
     * Configuration issue
     * Missing dependency
     * Environmental issue
     * Breaking change from refactoring

2. INVESTIGATION
   - Check git history for recent changes to this test
   - Check git history for recent changes to tested code
   - Review related tests for similar failures
   - Check if test was passing before refactoring
   - Identify when test started failing (git bisect if needed)

3. FIX IMPLEMENTATION
   - Implement fix based on root cause analysis
   - Update test code if test is incorrect
   - Update application code if application is incorrect
   - Update mocks/fixtures if setup is incorrect
   - Add missing dependencies if needed

4. VERIFICATION
   - Run the specific test to verify fix
   - Run related tests to ensure no regressions
   - Run full test suite to ensure no side effects
   - Verify test coverage is maintained or improved
   - Test edge cases related to the fix

5. DOCUMENTATION
   - Document root cause in report
   - Document fix approach in report
   - Document any related issues discovered
   - Update code comments if needed
   - Update test documentation if needed

DELIVERABLES:
=============

[ ] Root cause analysis completed
[ ] Fix implemented and tested
[ ] Related tests verified
[ ] Report generated in reports/test-failures/
[ ] Task marked as complete

REPORT REQUIREMENTS:
====================

Create report: reports/test-failures/report-task-69-test_monitoring_with_resource_coordination.txt

Report must include:
1. Test failure summary
2. Root cause analysis
3. Fix description and implementation
4. Verification results
5. Any related issues discovered
6. Recommendations for preventing similar failures

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
====================

- Test passes successfully
- No new test failures introduced
- Root cause documented
- Fix is appropriate and maintainable
- Report is complete and clear

DEPENDENCIES:
=============

- Access to test suite
- Access to application code
- Ability to run tests
- Understanding of tested functionality

NOTES:
======

- This is part of systematic test failure resolution
- Coordinate with Task-34 (test changes review) if related
- Flag any discoveries that need user approval
- If fix requires significant refactoring, flag for approval before proceeding

[USER APPROVAL NEEDED]
If this test failure reveals a broader issue or requires significant changes beyond
simple bug fix, flag for user review before implementing large-scale changes.
