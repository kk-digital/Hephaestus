TASK-28: Run Full Test Suite and Document Results

## Status
PENDING - Blocked by Task-27

## Priority
HIGH - Need to verify refactoring didn't break functionality

## Dependencies

**Blocks:**
- Task-27 must be complete (import fixes)

**Blocked by:**
Nothing after Task-27 complete

## Objective

Run the complete test suite and document:
1. Total tests collected
2. Pass/fail/skip counts
3. Any error patterns
4. Performance regressions (if any)

## Test Execution Steps

### Step 1: Quick Import Test
[ ] Verify server.py imports: python -c "from src.mcp.server import app"
[ ] Verify test collection: pytest --collect-only
[ ] Should collect 406 tests with 0 errors

### Step 2: Run Test Suite
[ ] Run full suite: pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
[ ] Capture output to file: pytest tests/ -v > test-results.txt 2>&1
[ ] Note execution time

### Step 3: Analyze Results
[ ] Count passing tests
[ ] Count failing tests
[ ] Count skipped tests
[ ] Group failures by category (import, integration, unit, etc.)

### Step 4: Document Failures
For each failing test:
[ ] Test name
[ ] Error type (ImportError, AssertionError, etc.)
[ ] Root cause (if obvious)
[ ] Related to refactoring? (yes/no)

### Step 5: Report
[ ] Create test-results-251105.txt in tasks/
[ ] Update todo.txt with summary
[ ] Commit results

## Expected Outcomes

**Best Case:**
- All 406 tests pass
- No regressions from refactoring

**Likely Case:**
- Most tests pass
- Some failures due to:
  - Missing imports
  - Path changes
  - Service initialization issues

**Acceptable:**
- > 90% pass rate
- Failures are fixable
- No critical functionality broken

## Test Categories

1. Unit tests (c1 models, c2 services)
2. Integration tests (c3 routes, workflows)
3. End-to-end tests (full agent workflows)
4. MCP protocol tests
5. WebSocket tests
