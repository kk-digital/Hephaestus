TASK-30: Project Cleanup and Organization

## Status
PENDING

## Priority
LOW - Nice to have, not blocking

## Objective

Organize scattered documentation and temporary files into proper directory structure.

## Current State

Documentation files scattered across project root:
- EMBEDDINGS-EXPLAINED.txt
- LMSTUDIO-EMBEDDINGS.txt
- DEPENDENCY-ANALYSIS.txt
- SESSION-SUMMARY-*.txt
- Other analysis files

## Proposed Structure

```
Hephaestus/
├── cleanup/           (NEW - temporary/one-time files)
│   ├── migration-notes/
│   ├── analysis/
│   └── scratch/
├── reports/           (NEW - analysis reports)
│   ├── embeddings/
│   ├── architecture/
│   └── testing/
├── design_docs/       (EXISTING - keep)
├── tasks/             (EXISTING - keep)
└── ...
```

## Tasks

### Step 1: Create Directories
[ ] mkdir cleanup/
[ ] mkdir cleanup/migration-notes/
[ ] mkdir cleanup/analysis/
[ ] mkdir reports/
[ ] mkdir reports/embeddings/
[ ] mkdir reports/architecture/
[ ] mkdir reports/testing/

### Step 2: Categorize Files
[ ] List all .txt, .md files in project root
[ ] Categorize each:
  - Temporary/scratch → cleanup/
  - Analysis/reports → reports/
  - Documentation → design_docs/
  - Keep in root (README, LICENSE, etc.)

### Step 3: Move Files

**Embeddings Documentation:**
[ ] mv EMBEDDINGS-EXPLAINED.txt → reports/embeddings/
[ ] mv LMSTUDIO-EMBEDDINGS.txt → reports/embeddings/

**Architecture Analysis:**
[ ] mv DEPENDENCY-ANALYSIS.txt → reports/architecture/
[ ] mv *-layer-*.txt → reports/architecture/

**Session Summaries:**
[ ] mv SESSION-SUMMARY-*.txt → cleanup/migration-notes/

**Test Results:**
[ ] mv test-results-*.txt → reports/testing/

### Step 4: Update References
[ ] Search for hardcoded paths to moved files
[ ] Update references in:
  - README.md
  - todo.txt
  - Task files
  - Other documentation

### Step 5: Create Index Files
[ ] Create cleanup/README.md (explain structure)
[ ] Create reports/README.md (explain structure)
[ ] List contents of each subdirectory

### Step 6: Update .gitignore
[ ] Add cleanup/scratch/ to .gitignore
[ ] Keep cleanup/migration-notes/ tracked
[ ] Keep all reports/ tracked

## Files to Keep in Root

- README.md
- LICENSE
- requirements.txt
- pyproject.toml
- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile
- .env.example
- .gitignore
- todo.txt

## Validation

[ ] Project root has < 15 files
[ ] All documentation in proper subdirectories
[ ] No broken links to moved files
[ ] Git history preserved for moved files

## Commit Strategy

Option 1: Single commit
```bash
git add cleanup/ reports/
git commit -m "Organize project documentation (Task-30)"
```

Option 2: Multiple commits (per category)
```bash
git add reports/embeddings/
git commit -m "Move embedding docs to reports/ (Task-30)"
# ... repeat for each category
```

## Estimated Time

30-45 minutes

## Benefits

- Cleaner project root
- Easier navigation
- Clear separation of temporary vs permanent files
- Better onboarding for new developers
