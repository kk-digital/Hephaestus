TASK-27: Fix C2 Service Import Mismatches

## Status
PENDING - Blocks test suite

## Priority
CRITICAL - Tests cannot run until fixed

## Problem Description

The c3 routes import from c2 service modules that don't match actual locations:

**Import Issues:**
- c3_ticket_routes imports: from src.c2_ticket_services import TicketService
- Actual location: src/services/ticket_service.py (old location)
- Partial new location: src/c2_ticket_service/ (singular, not plural)

**Root Cause:**
During Task-25 (C2 extraction), services were moved to c2_* modules but:
1. Some services remained in old src/services/ directory
2. Module naming inconsistency (singular vs plural)
3. c3 routes created with assumption of completed c2 organization

## Files Affected

**C3 Routes with broken imports:**
- src/c3_ticket_routes/ticket_routes.py
- Possibly others (need audit)

**Services in wrong locations:**
- src/services/ticket_service.py
- src/services/ticket_search_service.py
- src/services/ticket_history_service.py
- src/services/git_service.py (if exists)

**Incorrectly named modules:**
- src/c2_ticket_service/ (should be c2_ticket_services)

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Audit Current State
[ ] List all files in src/services/
[ ] List all c2_* directories
[ ] Grep for all c2_* imports in c3 routes
[ ] Document mismatches

### Step 2: Reorganize Services
[ ] Rename src/c2_ticket_service/ → src/c2_ticket_services/
[ ] Move src/services/ticket_*.py → src/c2_ticket_services/
[ ] Move src/services/git_service.py → appropriate c2 module
[ ] Create __init__.py with proper exports

### Step 3: Update Imports
[ ] Update all c3_* routes imports
[ ] Update any other imports of moved services
[ ] Create backward compatibility shims in src/services/

### Step 4: Test Imports
[ ] Test: python -c "from src.c3_ticket_routes import create_ticket_router"
[ ] Test: python -c "from src.c2_ticket_services import TicketService"
[ ] Run pytest --collect-only (should collect 406 tests)

### Step 5: Commit
[ ] git add changes
[ ] git commit -m "Fix c2 service import mismatches (Task-27)"
[ ] git push

## Expected Outcome

- All c3 routes can import from c2 services without errors
- pytest --collect-only succeeds (collects 406 tests)
- Test suite can run (even if some tests fail)

## Blockers

None - can start immediately

## Estimated Time

30-60 minutes
