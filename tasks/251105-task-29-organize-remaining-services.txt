TASK-29: Organize Remaining Services from src/services/

## Status
PENDING

## Priority
MEDIUM - Cleanup and architectural consistency

## Context

During Task-25 (C2 extraction), most services were moved to c2_* modules.
However, some services remain in the old src/services/ directory.

This task completes the c2 layer organization.

## Objective

Move all remaining services from src/services/ to appropriate c2_* modules.

## Discovery Phase

### Step 1: Audit src/services/
[ ] List all .py files in src/services/
[ ] Categorize each service by domain:
  - Ticket services
  - Agent services
  - Task services
  - Workflow services
  - Other

### Step 2: Check c2_* modules
[ ] List all c2_* directories
[ ] Identify which services belong in which c2 module
[ ] Note any services that don't fit existing c2 modules

## Known Services to Migrate

**Ticket Services** (→ c2_ticket_services/):
- src/services/ticket_service.py
- src/services/ticket_search_service.py
- src/services/ticket_history_service.py

**Git Services** (→ c2_worktree_service/ or new c2_git_service/):
- src/services/git_service.py (if exists)

**Unknown** (need audit):
- Any other files in src/services/

## Migration Steps (Per Service)

For each service file:

1. **Determine Target Module**
   [ ] Identify which c2_* module it belongs to
   [ ] Create c2 module if none exists

2. **Move Service**
   [ ] Copy service to c2 module
   [ ] Update imports within service
   [ ] Add to c2 module __init__.py

3. **Create Compatibility Shim**
   [ ] Leave import shim in old location:
   ```python
   # src/services/ticket_service.py
   from src.c2_ticket_services.ticket_service import TicketService
   __all__ = ["TicketService"]
   ```

4. **Update Imports**
   [ ] Search for imports of old location
   [ ] Update to new c2 location
   [ ] Test imports work

5. **Test**
   [ ] Verify old imports still work (backward compat)
   [ ] Verify new imports work
   [ ] Run affected tests

## Expected Directory Structure After

```
src/
├── c2_ticket_services/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── ticket_service.py
│   ├── ticket_search_service.py
│   └── ticket_history_service.py
├── c2_worktree_service/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── worktree_service.py
│   └── git_service.py (maybe)
├── services/  (compatibility shims only)
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── ticket_service.py (imports from c2)
│   └── ...
```

## Validation

[ ] All services in src/services/ are shims (< 5 lines each)
[ ] All actual service code in c2_* modules
[ ] pytest --collect-only succeeds
[ ] All imports work (both old and new paths)

## Documentation

[ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md with c2 layer structure
[ ] Document migration in todo.txt
[ ] Note any services that needed new c2 modules

## Estimated Time

1-2 hours

## Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility with shims
- Don't break existing code
- Prefer moving to existing c2 modules over creating new ones
- If creating new c2 module, follow naming convention: c2_<domain>_service
