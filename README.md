## ⚡ Quick Setup (First Time)

**IMPORTANT:** After cloning the repository, you must configure your API keys before running Hephaestus.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kk-digital/Hephaestus.git
cd Hephaestus

# 2. Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Edit .env with your actual API keys
# Add your OpenAI, Anthropic, or other provider keys
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Why this step is required:**
- `.env` contains your secret API keys and is **never committed to git** (it's in `.gitignore`)
- `.env.example` is a template showing what configuration is needed
- This is standard practice for projects with secrets - keeps your keys safe

See [INSTALLATION.txt](INSTALLATION.txt) for complete setup instructions and troubleshooting.

## The Problem I Kept Running Into

I was trying to build a system where AI agents could handle complex software projects. You know the kind: "Build me an authentication system with OAuth, JWT, rate limiting, and comprehensive tests."

Traditional agentic frameworks can branch and loop, but they have a limitation: **every branch needs predefined instructions.** You must write the task descriptions upfront for every scenario you anticipate.

But what about discoveries you didn't anticipate? When a testing agent finds an optimization opportunity, a security issue, or a better architectural pattern?

Here's what I tried instead: **Define logical phase types that are needed to solve problems - like "Plan → Implement → Test" - and let agents create tasks in ANY phase based on what they discover.**

## What Actually Happened: A Branching Tree That Builds Itself

Instead of a rigid sequence, I set up phase types:
- **Phase 1 (Analysis)**: Understanding, planning, investigation
- **Phase 2 (Implementation)**: Building, fixing, optimizing
- **Phase 3 (Validation)**: Testing, verification, quality checks

The key insight: **Agents can spawn tasks in any phase they want.**

A validation agent testing your auth system might discover an elegant caching pattern. Instead of being stuck (or following predefined branching logic you wrote), the agent:

1. **Creates a Phase 1 investigation task**: "Analyze auth caching pattern - could apply to 12 other API routes for 40% speedup"
2. **Keeps working** on their validation task
3. Another agent picks up the investigation task and explores it

The workflow just branched itself. Not because you predicted "if optimization found, spawn investigation task" - but because the agent discovered something worth exploring and had the freedom to create work for it.

This creates a **branching tree of tasks** that grows based on actual discoveries, not anticipated scenarios.

Let me show you what this looks like in practice:

### Example: Building from a PRD

I give Hephaestus a product requirements document: "Build a web application with authentication, REST API, and a React frontend."

**Phase 1 agent** reads the PRD and identifies 5 major components:
1. Authentication system
2. REST API layer
3. React frontend
4. Database schema
5. Background workers

It spawns **5 Phase 2 tasks** — one for each component. Now I have 5 agents building in parallel, each focused on one piece.

One of the **Phase 2 agents** finishes the REST API and spawns a **Phase 3 validation task**: "Test the REST API endpoints."

The **Phase 3 agent** starts testing. Everything passes. But then it notices something:

> "The auth endpoints use a caching pattern that reduces database queries by 60%. This could speed up all API routes significantly."

**Here's where it gets interesting.**

The Phase 3 agent doesn't just log this observation and move on. It doesn't get stuck because there's no "investigate optimizations" in the workflow plan.

Instead, it **spawns a new Phase 1 investigation task**: "Analyze auth caching pattern — could apply to other API routes for major performance gain."

<div align="center">

<p><em>Real-time view: 2 agents working across 3 phases, Guardian monitoring at 90% coherence</em></p>
</div>

A new Phase 1 agent spawns, investigates the caching pattern, confirms it's viable, and spawns a **Phase 2 implementation task**: "Apply caching pattern to all API routes."

Another agent implements it. Another agent validates it.

**The workflow just branched itself.** No one planned for this optimization. An agent discovered it during testing and created new work to explore it.

Meanwhile, a different Phase 3 agent is testing the authentication component. Tests fail. So it spawns a **Phase 2 bug fix task**: "Fix auth token expiry validation — current implementation allows expired tokens."

The fix agent implements the solution and spawns **Phase 3 retest**: "Validate auth fixes."

### What Just Happened?

Look at what emerged:

    P1[Phase 1: Analyze PRD<br/>Creates 5 tickets] --> P2A[Phase 2: Build Auth]
    P1 --> P2B[Phase 2: Build API]

    P2A --> P3A[Phase 3: Test Auth]
    P3A -->|tests fail| P2Fix[Phase 2: Fix Auth Bug]
    P2Fix --> P3Retest[Phase 3: Retest Auth]

    style P3B fill:#fff3e0
    style P1New fill:#e1f5fe
    style P2Fix fill:#ffebee
```

**This workflow built itself:**
- Started with 1 analysis task
- Branched into 5 parallel implementation tasks
- One testing phase discovered optimization → spawned 3-phase investigation branch
- Another testing phase found bugs → spawned fix → retest loop
- All coordinated through Kanban tickets with blocking relationships

## Why This Changes Everything

**Traditional workflows:** Predict every scenario upfront → rigid plan → breaks when reality diverges

**Hephaestus approach:** Define work types → agents discover → workflow adapts in real-time

The workflow adapts in real-time based on what agents actually discover, not what we predicted upfront.

## The Semi-Structured Sweet Spot

Here's why this is "semi-structured" and why that matters:

**Fully structured workflows** (traditional frameworks):
- ❌ Require predefined prompts for every scenario
- ❌ Can branch/loop, but need fixed instructions for each path
- ❌ Must anticipate all discoveries upfront

**Fully unstructured agents** (chaos):
- ❌ No coordination
- ❌ Duplicate work
- ❌ Contradictory changes
- ❌ No clear success criteria

**Semi-structured (Hephaestus)**:
- ✅ **Phase definitions** provide work type structure and guidelines
- ✅ **Agents write task descriptions** dynamically based on discoveries
- ✅ **Kanban tickets** coordinate work with blocking relationships
- ✅ **Guardian monitoring** ensures agents stay aligned with phase goals
- ✅ Workflow adapts to what agents actually find, not what you predicted

You get **structure where it matters**:
- Phase types define what kind of work is happening
- Done definitions set clear completion criteria
- Guardian validates alignment with phase instructions
- Tickets track dependencies and prevent chaos

And **flexibility where you need it**:
- Agents create detailed task descriptions on the fly
- No need to predefine every possible branch
- Discoveries drive workflow expansion in real-time
- New work types emerge as agents explore
